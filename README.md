Recipe for chocolate fudge brownies

INGREDIENTS:

100g Chocolate (plain or milk works well)
100g Butter/Marg
200g Self Raising Flour
200g Sugar (Soft brown sugar works best but caster sugar still works well)
3 large eggs
2 tablespoons cocoa powder

Optional Ingredients I use:
Serve with Marshmallows
Chocolate chips
Chocolate sauce
Chocolate flakes

HOW TO MAKE IT:

*STEP 1*
Melt the chocolate and butter together in a sauce pan over a low heat

*STEP 2*
Turn off the heat and gradually stir in the sugar and eggs and mix it well

*STEP 3*
Add the self raising flour and cocoa powder

*STEP 4*
Pour the mix into greased 30cm x 35cm square tin
Chocolate chips can be added to a chocolate batter made by you consisting of butter and cocoa powder with an egg, which will be a layer of chocolate sauce!

*STEP 5*
Bake for 15 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius, the middle should be soft. Let the brownies cool in the tin for 10-15 mins.
Serving with marshmallows and a seasoning of chocolate sauce and flakes is optional.

*STEP 6*
ENJOY!!!!! :)
